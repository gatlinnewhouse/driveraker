#### About the name

driveraker is styled without capitalization. The name derives from the term [muckraker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker), an insult (or compliment) directed at journalists, I named driveraker such because driveraker aims to integrate Google Drive with a static site generator like Hugo in order to provide a website for a news publication.
