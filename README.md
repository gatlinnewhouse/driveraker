# driveraker

A Google Drive to static site generator via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc), and [Drive](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive). Created for [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) under the supervision of [Portland State University](http://wiki.cs.pdx.edu/psu-gsoc/index.html).

#### About the name

driveraker is styled without capitalization. Deriving from the term [muckraker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muckraker), an insult (or compliment) directed at journalists; I named driveraker such because driveraker aims to integrate Google Drive with a static site generator like Hugo in order to provide a website for a news publication.
